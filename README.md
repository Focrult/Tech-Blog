  ## Description
  The task for this challenge is to develop a tech blog! More specifically a CMS style blog site that is similar to a Wordpress site, with the intention to allow other fellow devs to publish their blog posts and comment on other developer posts! This is an application built from scratch and deployed on Heroku. This application follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, and takes advantage of the following technologies: Handlebars.js, Sequelize and the express-session npm package.

  ## Installation
  With the approrpiate package name and versions already included inside the package.json file, the user will perform an npm install in their terminal. This will install all relevant dependencies.
  
  Furthermore the user will be required to complete the following instructions to use this application:
  * Step 1: 'mysql -u root -p' into the terminal.
  * Step 2: 'source db/schema.sql' Will DROP and CREATE DB.
  * Step 3: 'npm run seed'
  * Step 4: 'npm start'
